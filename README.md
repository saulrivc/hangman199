# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the **computer thinks of a word** and the **user tries to guess it** one letter at a time.

## 📖 Description

This beginner-friendly project focuses on the **early stages of a Hangman game**, including:

- Selecting a random word from a list
- Prompting the user to input a guess
- Validating the input to ensure it's a **single alphabetical letter**
- Providing appropriate feedback

It sets the groundwork for building a fully functional Hangman game with tracking correct/incorrect guesses, number of lives, and visual display of progress.

### 💡 What I learned

- How to use the `random` module, specifically `random.choice()`
- How to take user input with `input()`
- How to perform basic input validation (`isalpha()` and `len()`)
- Structuring a Python script to separate logic clearly

## 🛠 Installation
